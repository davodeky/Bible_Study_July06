	  </p>
		 <h4>This Week's Scriptures</h4>
		 <ul>
		   <li><a href = "https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Esther+4%3A13-14&version=ESV"> Esther 4:13-14 </a> </li>
		 </ul>
		 <h4>Pointers</h4>
		 <div class="container">
		 <div class = "col-lg-6 col-sm-12">
		 <ul>
		   <li>Like Esther, we have in respective ways been called to play role in the plan of God. </li>
		   <li>Esther had been put in that place at that time because God had a job for her to do.</li>
		   <li>So she had to step up to the plate and get to work.</li>
		   <li>We all have a purpose and a calling- the timing could be that writing on the wall. </li>
		   <li>In order to grow, we need to understand the times that we are living in so as to be effective in our ministries.</li>
		 </ul>
		 
		 
		 <h3>Discussion Questions</h3>
		 <ul>
		 <li>In light of the time that we are living in, how do you see God using you as His ambassador here on earth?</li>
		 <li>What role can the church play in this world today?</li>
		 <li>How can we grow as christians and as members of our respective communities and families in such a time where there seems to be limitations coming from all directions? </li>
		 </ul>

		 <h4>Biblical Insights</h4>
		 <ul>
		 <li><a href = "https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Habakkuk+2%3A3&version=NKJV">Habakkuk 2:2</a></li>
		 <li>We live in the &ldquo; micro-wave&rdquo; time. </li>
		 <li>We have become too impatient with ourselves and with one another</li>
		 <li>To grow we sometimes have to be patient in waiting &hyphen; patience is a virtue.</li>
